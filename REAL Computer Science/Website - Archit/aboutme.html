      <h1>About Me</h1>
            <h2>My Love for Hockey</h2>
 <p>My name is Archit Patel and I love hockey. Ever since I was a little kid, my family and I would gather every Saturday to watch the Toronto Maple Leafs play on T.V. My love for hockey grew every Saturday. Because of this, I asked my dad to sign me up for our local hockey league, the Mississauga Hockey Leauge (<em>MHL</em>). I played in that league for 6 years until I switched to ball hockey. Hockey has always been apart of my life in some way and I always felt connected to the sport in some way which is why I love the game so much.</p>

            <h2>Other Hobbies and Interests</h2>
<p>Other than hockey, my other hobbies/interests include, basketball, technology, video games, biology, etc. Basketball is another sport that I have came to love over the last couple of years. In the summer, my cousins and I would always play basketball outside until it got dark and used to watch the Toronto Raptors on T.V every time they play</p>
